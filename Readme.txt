Adventure Game is a text based application or program that runs and generates possible outcomes
when making a choice. The documentation have functions and correlates to specific functions that
aligns with each module of code. This README documents is for game developers who are motivated
to learn and attain knowledge on what's to come as a programmer. It's quite complex, but it'll
take some time.

information needed:

main function - To introduce each module or chapter of the program without having to type print statments
every minute.

functions - Some functions could be used to acess directories within the program so that
it aligns with others

if statement - you can use conditional statements to seperate the choices and help
make choices that are relevant to the ones you want to make

While loops - while loops can loop the program, yet its possible to recreate the entire
chapter, in case you want a retry the specific chapter or scene.

Useful information:

 when you run into syntax errors, ensure that you debug your code and practice it to
 perfect the code without having too many erros.

 Some errors give you the line module to check if you have a malfunction in your code.
 You could ask for help or ask a friend to use it and check to see what's wrong with your program.
